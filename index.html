    <h2 style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Renewable energy is energy from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat.Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation.Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling. Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development</p>

    <section id="solar">
      <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
      <p>Solar energy is a clean and renewable source of power obtained from the sun's radiation. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity.</p>
     <p>
        <ul>
            Solar energy is commonly used for: 
<li> Water heaters</li>
<li> House heating</li>
<li> Generating electricity</li>

    <section id="wind">
      <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
      <p>Wind energy is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that harnesses the power of the wind to generate electricity. Here are some key points highlighting the benefits and features of wind energy: Wind energy is renewable because it relies on the Earth's natural wind patterns, which are continuously replenished. As long as the sun continues to shine and the Earth rotates, wind energy will be available. Unlike fossil fuels, wind energy does not produce air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions during operation. It helps reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment. By displacing electricity generated from fossil fuels, wind energy helps decrease the overall carbon footprint, mitigating the impact of climate change. It plays a crucial role in transitioning to a low-carbon or carbon-neutral energy system.Harnessing wind energy reduces dependence on finite fossil fuel resources, promoting energy security and independence for countries. Once a wind turbine is installed, its operational and maintenance costs are relatively low compared to conventional power plants. Advances in technology and improved efficiency have made wind energy more economically viable over time.The wind energy industry creates jobs in manufacturing, installation, operation, and maintenance of wind turbines. This can contribute to economic growth and the development of a skilled workforce in the renewable energy sector.Ongoing research and development in wind turbine technology have led to improvements in efficiency, design, and cost-effectiveness. Innovations such as larger turbines, better materials, and smarter grid integration continue to enhance the performance of wind energy systems.
        Despite its advantages, it's essential to address challenges associated with wind energy, such as intermittency, potential environmental impacts, and community acceptance, to ensure its sustainable integration into the broader energy landscape.</p>

    <section id="hydropower">
      <h2>Hydropower</h2>
      <p>Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is generated by the flow of water. Dams or turbines capture the energy from flowing water.</p>
     <p>Hydropower works by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power. This is achieved by using a dam or diversion structure to alter the natural flow of a river or other body of water. The potential power that can be derived from a volume of water is directly proportional to the working head. 
        Hydropower is among the most cost-effective means of generating electricity and is often the preferred method where available. It currently accounts for 28.7% of total U.S. renewable electricity generation and about 6.2% of total U.S. electricity generation. 
        Advantages of hydropower include: 
       <ul>
        <li> Flexibility</li>
       <li> High value power</li>
       <li> Suitability for industrial applications</li>
        Disadvantages of hydropower include: 
       <li> Ecosystem damage and loss of land</li>
       <li> Drought and water loss by evaporation</li>
    </p>

    <section id="bioenergy">
        <h2>BioEnergy</h2>
        <p>Bioenergy stands at the forefront of renewable energy solutions, harnessing the inherent power stored in organic materials to generate heat, electricity, and biofuels. This versatile and sustainable form of energy derives from biomass, which encompasses a diverse range of sources such as agricultural crops, forestry residues, organic waste, and dedicated energy crops.
            The sources of biomass can be diverse, ranging from plant-based materials to organic waste. One of the key advantages of bioenergy lies in its renewability.  Bioenergy is often considered carbon neutral or low carbon because the carbon dioxide released during combustion is roughly equal to the amount absorbed by the plants during their growth. This contrasts with fossil fuels, which release carbon that has been sequestered for millions of years, contributing to a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Unlike finite fossil fuels, biomass can be replenished through natural processes or human cultivation, forming a closed carbon cycle. Bioenergy contributes to energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels, offering a sustainable solution that aligns with global efforts to transition towards cleaner energy sources. It also plays a crucial role in waste management, as organic waste materials can be converted into valuable bioenergy resources, reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal. However, the journey towards a bioenergy-powered future is not without challenges. Sustainable practices must be prioritized to prevent negative environmental impacts, such as deforestation and competition with food production. Bioenergy projects should undergo thorough environmental impact assessments, ensuring responsible development and adherence to sustainability criteria. Its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote rural development, and foster a circular economy underscores its importance in the broader context of sustainable energy solutions.</p>

    <section id="geothermal">
    <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that comes from heat within the Earth. The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). 
        Geothermal energy comes from: 
        <ul>
       <li> The original formation of the planet</li>
       <li> The radioactive decay of materials</li>
       <li> Geothermal energy is stored in rocks and fluids in the center of the earth. Hot rocks in the earth's core emit heat which generates steam and pressure that comes out of the earth's surface. This steam can be used to run turbines and produce electricity.</li> 
       <li> Geothermal energy has been used for millennia as a source of heat and/or electric power. People use geothermal heat for: Bathing, Heating buildings, Generating electricity. </li>
       <li> Some advantages of geothermal energy include: </li>
       <li> Generally environmentally friendly</li>
        <li>Renewable and sustainable</li>
       <li> Massive potential</li>
       <li> Reliable</li>
    <h2>Disadvantages Of Geothermal Energy</h2>
       </ul>
        Some disadvantages of geothermal energy include: 
       <ul> <li>Some minor environmental issues</li>
       <li> Sustainability relies on reservoirs being properly managed</li>
       <li> Location-specific</li>
       <li> High initial costs</li>

      <h2>Other Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
      <p>Scientists and engineers are constantly working to harness other renewable energy sources. Three of the most promising are tidal energy, wave energy, and algal (or algae) fuel.

        Tidal energy harnesses the power of ocean tides to generate electricity. Some tidal energy projects use the moving tides to turn the blades of a turbine. Other projects use small dams to continually fill reservoirs at high tide and slowly release the water (and turn turbines) at low tide.
        
        Wave energy harnesses waves from the ocean, lakes, or rivers. Some wave energy projects use the same equipment that tidal energy projects do—dams and standing turbines. Other wave energy projects float directly on waves. The water’s constant movement over and through these floating pieces of equipment turns turbines and creates electricity.
        
        Algal fuel is a type of biomass energy that uses the unique chemicals in seaweed to create a clean and renewable biofuel. Algal fuel does not need the acres of cropland that other biofuel feedstocks do.</p>
